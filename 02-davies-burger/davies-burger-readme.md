## Tasks

1. Let’s begin with styling the `<nav>` element containing the logo and navigation elements. Set the width of the img to 180 pixels. Center the img horizontally using the margin property.

2. Set margin of `span` elements inside the nav to 10 pixels on the top and bottom, and 0 pixels on the left and right..

3. Now set some rules for the element with the class `content`. This element is a container for all the elements not included in `<nav>`. Set the `height` to 500 pixels. Create `10-pixel` vertical margins and automatic horizontal margins. Set `.body` elements inside `.content` to have no vertical margin and automatic horizontal margins so that it is centered

4. With a 500-pixel height for `.content`, some elements will overflow out of its box if the browser window is made too small.Make `.content` scrollable with the overflow property. Resize the browser window so it is very skinny and notice that this section is now scrollable.

5. Set the height of the .header class to 320 pixels. Create a 20-pixel padding for the h1 element inside the .header. Set vertical margins to 0 pixels and the horizontal margins to be determined automatically for the same h1 element..

6. Now add some box-model formatting to the ‘ORDER NOW’ .button element. As you make each change, make sure to scroll down if necessary to view the effect on the button. Set the width to 200 pixels. Set the padding to 20 pixels. Set the vertical margins to 40 pixels and the horizontal margins to automatic. Give the button a 1-pixel, solid, blue border.

7. Finally, style the nutrition facts section at the bottom. In the element selected with ul.nutrition: Set the padding of the `ul.nutrition` element to 20 pixels. Set the width of li elements within the ul.nutrition to 200 pixels. Set a 10-pixel vertical padding and 20-pixel horizontal padding to the same elements. Add a 3-pixel bottom margin to the same elements.
